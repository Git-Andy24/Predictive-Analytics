## Conclusion:

1. K-Means generally performs well with higher silhouette and Calinski-Harabasz scores.

2. Hierarchical clustering also shows competitive performance, especially with 3 clusters.

3. Mean-Shift clustering adapts to data but may result in varying cluster sizes.

4. The impact of preprocessing varies, with PCA improving interpretability but sometimes reducing clustering performance.
